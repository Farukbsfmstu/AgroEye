# AgroEye
This project demonstrates a Smart Agriculture System powered by AgroEye drones, developed entirely using Core Java and the Java Collections Framework. It simulates drone operations in the field to monitor crops, detect issues, and optimize agricultural tasks such as watering, spraying, and area coverage.
🌱 Key Features

    🛰️ Drone Simulation: Simulates AgroEye drones flying over fields to monitor crops.

    📍 Field Coverage Mapping: Uses data structures like maps and lists to represent agricultural zones.

    💧 Smart Irrigation Alerts: Analyzes soil moisture data and suggests irrigation schedules.

    🐛 Pest Detection Logic: Mimics pest detection based on predefined rules and patterns.

    📊 Data Collection: Collects simulated environmental data (temperature, humidity, etc.) using custom Java classes.

💻 Tech Stack

    Language: Java (Core Java)

    Libraries: Java Collections Framework 

    Concepts Used:

        OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

        Data Structures (ArrayList, HashMap, LinkedList, etc.)

📦 How It Works

    The system initializes a virtual farm with field sections.

    Each drone is assigned to a section and gathers crop data (e.g., moisture, temperature).

    Based on the data, the system generates alerts or actions.

    All operations are managed using Java collections for efficient data handling.

🎯 Use Cases

    Academic demonstration of Java-based simulations.

    Concept prototyping for IoT-based smart farming.

    Training on OOP and Java Collections in a real-world scenario.
